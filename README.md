## About the game
In a normal difficulty game of a 3x3 grid of bombs, each bomb will light up and explode unless defused when the user clicks the bomb. In the grid, a bomb will randomly light up and if not touched, the bomb will explode and lose the game. As the game progresses, the time in between bombs lighting up will speed up making the game harder as it goes on.
