## Game Rundown
* On page load, initial difficulty is set to normal, where the time for bomb to blow up is 1 to 1.5 seconds. Easy is 1.5 to 2 seconds, whereas hard is .45 to .5 seconds.
* Upon clicking start, the first bomb lights up and the user must click it to defuse it in order for the next bomb to appear. 
* Game continues until a bomb explodes, thus ending the game. The high score will be updated.
* Upon clicking start from a game over, the board resets and a new game begins.
* Upon clicking reset from either a current ongoing game or a game over, the board will reset.
